# Online-Train-Ticket-Booking-System
The Indian Railways (IR) carries about 5.5 lakhs passengers in reserved accommodation every day. The number of the reservation counters available to the passengers and customers are very less. On most of the reservation systems, there are long queues, so it takes a long time for any individual to book the ticket. As now there are no call centers facilities available to solve the queries of the passengers. So with our system we can solve the issue. These tickets can be booked or cancelled for journeys commencing in any part of India and ending in any other part, with registration id. It also facilitates the passengers to enquiry about the trains available on the basis of source and destination, enquiry about the status of the booked ticket (PNR Status). With the help of online booking, people can book their tickets online through internet sitting in their home by a single click. Using their credit cards/debit cards/online payments, people can easily get their tickets done within minutes.
